    "# Introduction: Home Credit Default Risk Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended for those who are new to machine learning competitions or want a gentle introduction to the problem. I purposely avoid jumping into complicated models or joining together lots of data in order to show the basics of how to get started in machine learning! Any comments or suggestions are much appreciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take an initial look at the Home Credit default risk machine learning competition currently hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Supervised__: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features\n",
    "* __Classification__: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided by [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net/about-us.aspx), a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. Predicting whether or not a client will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need, and Home Credit is hosting this competition on Kaggle to see what sort of models the machine learning community can develop to help them in this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 different sources of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* application_train/application_test: the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. \n",
    "* bureau: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "* bureau_balance: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n",
    "* previous_application: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n",
    "* POS_CASH_BALANCE: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n",
    "* credit_card_balance: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "* installments_payment: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram shows how all of the data is related:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/home_credit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we are provided with the definitions of all the columns (in `HomeCredit_columns_description.csv`) and an example of the expected submission file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will stick to using only the main application training and testing data. Although if we want to have any hope of seriously competing, we need to use all the data, for now we will stick to one file which should be more manageable. This will let us establish a baseline that we can then improve upon. With these projects, it's best to build up an understanding of the problem a little at a time rather than diving all the way in and getting completely lost! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric: ROC AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a grasp of the data (reading through the [column descriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data) helps immensely), we need to understand the metric by which our submission is judged. In this case, it is a common classification metric known as the [Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC, also sometimes called AUROC)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132777/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC AUC may sound intimidating, but it is relatively straightforward once you can get your head around the two individual concepts. The [Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) graphs the true positive rate versus the false positive rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](http://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ROC-curve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A single line on the graph indicates the curve for a single model, and movement along a line indicates changing the threshold used for classifying a positive instance. The threshold starts at 0 in the upper right to and goes to 1 in the lower left. A curve that is to the left and above another curve indicates a better model. For example, the blue model is better than the red model, which is better than the black diagonal line which indicates a naive random guessing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Area Under the Curve (AUC)](http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm) explains itself by its name! It is simply the area under the ROC curve. (This is the integral of the curve.) This metric is between 0 and 1 with a better model scoring higher. A model that simply guesses at random will have an ROC AUC of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we measure a classifier according to the ROC AUC, we do not generation 0 or 1 predictions, but rather a probability between 0 and 1. This may be confusing because we usually like to think in terms of accuracy, but when we get into problems with inbalanced classes (we will see this is the case), accuracy is not the best metric. For example, if I wanted to build a model that could detect terrorists with 99.9999% accuracy, I would simply make a model that predicted every single person was not a terrorist. Clearly, this would not be effective (the recall would be zero) and we use more advanced metrics such as ROC AUC or the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) to more accurately reflect the performance of a classifier. A model with a high ROC AUC will also have a high accuracy, but the [ROC AUC is a better representation of model performance.](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/806/advantages-of-auc-vs-standard-accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not that we know the background of the data we are using and the metric to maximize, let's get into exploring the data. In this notebook, as mentioned previously, we will stick to the main data sources and simple models which we can build upon in future work. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Follow-up Notebooks__\n",
    "\n",
    "For those looking to keep working on this problem, I have a series of follow-up notebooks:\n",

The goal of EDA is to learn what our data can tell us. It generally starts out with a high level overview, then narrows in to specific areas as we find intriguing areas of the data. The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use."

    "## Encoding Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, we need to deal with pesky categorical variables.  A machine learning model unfortunately cannot deal with categorical variables (except for some models such as [LightGBM](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Features.html)). Therefore, we have to find a way to encode (represent) these variables as numbers before handing them off to the model. There are two main ways to carry out this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Label encoding: assign each unique category in a categorical variable with an integer. No new columns are created. An example is shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/label_encoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-hot encoding: create a new column for each unique category in a categorical variable. Each observation recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding category and a 0 in all other new columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/one_hot_encoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with label encoding is that it gives the categories an arbitrary ordering. The value assigned to each of the categories is random and does not reflect any inherent aspect of the category. In the example above, programmer recieves a 4 and data scientist a 1, but if we did the same process again, the labels could be reversed or completely different. The actual assignment of the integers is arbitrary. Therefore, when we perform label encoding, the model might use the relative value of the feature (for example programmer = 4 and data scientist = 1) to assign weights which is not what we want. If we only have two unique values for a categorical variable (such as Male/Female), then label encoding is fine, but for more than 2 unique categories, one-hot encoding is the safe option.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches, and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. [Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9443/when-to-use-one-hot-encoding-vs-labelencoder-vs-dictvectorizor). I think (and this is just a personal opinion) for categorical variables with many classes, one-hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. The only downside to one-hot encoding is that the number of features (dimensions of the data) can explode with categorical variables with many categories. To deal with this, we can perform one-hot encoding followed by [PCA](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc453/student_tutorials/principal_components.pdf) or other [dimensionality reduction methods](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/dimension-reduction-methods/) to reduce the number of dimensions (while still trying to preserve information). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use Label Encoding for any categorical variables with only 2 categories and One-Hot Encoding for any categorical variables with more than 2 categories. This process may need to change as we get further into the project, but for now, we will see where this gets us. (We will also not use any dimensionality reduction in this notebook but will explore in future iterations)."

One-hot encoding has created more columns in the training data because there were some categorical variables with categories not represented in the testing data.

First we extract the target column from the training data (because this is not in the testing data but we need to keep this information). When we do the align, we must make sure to set `axis = 1` to align the dataframes based on the columns and not on the rows!"

These may be due to mis-typed numbers, errors in measuring equipment, or they could be valid but extreme measurements. One way to support anomalies quantitatively is by looking at the statistics of a column using the `describe` method. The numbers in the `DAYS_BIRTH` column are negative because they are recorded relative to the current loan application. To see these stats in years, we can mutliple by -1 and divide by the number of days in a year:\n",

One of the safest approaches is just to set the anomalies to a missing value and then have them filled in (using Imputation) before machine learning. In this case, since all the anomalies have the exact same value, we want to fill them in with the same value in case all of these loans share something in common. The anomalous values seem to have some importance, so we want to tell the machine learning model if we did in fact fill in these values. As a solution, we will fill in the anomalous values with not a number (`np.nan`) and then create a new boolean column indicating whether or not the value was anomalous.\n",

Looking at the documentation, `DAYS_BIRTH` is the age in days of the client at the time of the loan in negative days (for whatever reason!). The correlation is positive, but the value of this feature is actually negative, meaning that as the client gets older, they are less likely to default on their loan (ie the target == 0). That's a little confusing, so we will take the absolute value of the feature and then the correlation will be negative."

    "One simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. \n",

We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py)).

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we saw how to get started with a Kaggle machine learning competition. We first made sure to understand the data, our task, and the metric by which our submissions will be judged. Then, we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships, trends, or anomalies that may help our modeling. Along the way, we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and scaling features to a range. Then, we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data exploration, data preparation, and feature engineering was complete, we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to beat our first score. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We followed the general outline of a [machine learning project](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-machine-learning-walk-through-in-python-part-one-c62152f39420): \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Understand the problem and the data\n",
    "2. Data cleaning and formatting (this was mostly done for us)\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "4. Baseline model\n",
    "5.  Improved model\n",
    "6. Model interpretation (just a little)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning competitions do differ slightly from typical data science problems in that we are concerned only with achieving the best performance on a single metric and do not care about the interpretation. However, by attempting to understand how our models make decisions, we can try to improve them or examine the mistakes in order to correct the errors. In future notebooks we will look at incorporating more sources of data, building more complex models (by following the code of others), and improving our scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this notebook was able to get you up and running in this machine learning competition and that you are now ready to go out on your own - with help from the community - and start working on some great problems! \n",
    "\n",
    "__Running the notebook__: now that we are at the end of the notebook, you can hit the blue Commit & Run button to execute all the code at once. After the run is complete (this should take about 10 minutes), you can then access the files that were created by going to the versions tab and then the output sub-tab. The submission files can be directly submitted to the competition from this tab or they can be downloaded to a local machine and saved. The final part is to share the share the notebook: go to the settings tab and change the visibility to Public. This allows the entire world to see your work! \n",

    "# Just for Fun: Light Gradient Boosting Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Now (if you want, this part is entirely optional) we can step off the deep end and use a real machine learning model: the [gradient boosting machine](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/) using the [LightGBM library](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quick-Start.html)! The Gradient Boosting Machine is currently the leading model for learning on structured datasets (especially on Kaggle) and we will probably need some form of this model to do well in the competition. Don't worry, even if this code looks intimidating, it's just a series of small steps that build up to a complete model. I added this code just to show what may be in store for this project, and because it gets us a slightly better score on the leaderboard. In future notebooks we will see how to work with more advanced models (which mostly means adapting existing code to make it work better), feature engineering, and feature selection. See you in the next notebook!  "
